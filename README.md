#Whatsapp Signal Notifier

Now whenever someone messages you on Whatsapp, this program will reply that you have moved to Signal.
It ignores group messages.

##How to use:
On first run, it generates a qrcode image which you have to scan using Whatsapp-Web option on your phone and login.
On subsequent runs, it uses the session to login.
